# Release v1.14.2: UI Polish & Documentation Sync

This release fixes a persistent issue where a purple background box could still appear during Multi-Site Analysis and updates the project documentation to mirror the recent mesh planning advancements.

## Bug Fixes

- **Final UI Cleanup**: Fixed a condition where the viewshed's purple "shadow" overlay would persist on the map during optimization scans. Map readability is now fully restored.

## Documentation Updates

- **README Sync**: The main project documentation now fully reflects the v1.14 features:
  - Inter-Node Link Matrix details.
  - Marginal Coverage analysis metrics.
  - Mesh Topology and connectivity scoring.
  - Updated propagation model guidance.
